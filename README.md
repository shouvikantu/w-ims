## General Notes/ Best practices

You can find how to start and run the program from the text below. Let's not put anything in the index.js file but just the components. If you look at the components folder, you'll see I made a Header.js file and I've added it to the index.js file. This makes organizing way easier and the code looks cleaner as well. 

Run 'npm install' after cloning the repo and it will install all the packages I install on my system. Oh. to run the npm commands, please download NODEJS on your system. Tailwindcss has been installed and I would like you guys to give it a try since it's convenient. 

For faster development, consider downloading the following extensions for VS Code: 
1. Enable emmet to get auto completion. Go to setting, search emmet and add an item for emmet. should look like: "javascript :  reactjavascript
2. ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets by dsznajder - If you write rafce in your .js file, it will add a functional component
3. TailwindCSS intellisence. It gives suggestions and autocompletion for tailwindcss
4. Prettier -  Makes your code well-formatted and "beautiful😂"

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
